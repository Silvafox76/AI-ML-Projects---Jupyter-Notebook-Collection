# 🧠 AI & ML Projects - Jupyter Notebook Collection

Welcome to my curated collection of hands-on labs, experiments, and final projects in AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. This repo is organized thematically by topic and aligned with my certification and learning journey across IBM, MIT, Google, and Microsoft platforms.

## 📚 Contents

- **Generative AI** — Prompt engineering, LangChain agents, embeddings, vector search
- **Classical ML** — Regression, classification, clustering, model evaluation
- **Deep Learning** — PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, CNNs, Autoencoders, Dropout studies
- **Natural Language Processing** — Transformers, tokenization, text analysis
- **Data Engineering** — Feature engineering, data cleaning, EDA
- **Final Assessments** — Peer-graded and capstone notebooks from IBM, MIT, and others

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python · PyTorch · TensorFlow · Keras · Scikit-learn · Pandas · NumPy  
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook · HuggingFace Transformers · LangChain · OpenAI APIs

## 🧩 Repo Structure

Each directory includes:
- Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Dataset links or synthetic data generation cells
- README (in progress) per directory with notebook goals

## 🤖 Notable Projects

- **LLM Prompt Strategies** — Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought in production
- **CNN Architectures in PyTorch** — From scratch with training pipelines
- **Dropout, Bias/Variance Experiments** — Insightful breakdown of under/overfitting
- **Classification Projects** — MNIST, real-world fraud detection, sentiment analysis
- **Vector Embeddings** — Semantic search with ChromaDB and `sentence-transformers`

## 📈 Goal

To showcase hands-on technical depth across the AI/ML lifecycle: from data ingestion to model training, tuning, and production deployment techniques.
