    "## **Part 1:** Making A Custom Server For SDXL with FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we can make a server to wrap the SDXL API you experimented with at the end of Notebook 5. This is intended as an example application derived largely from the HuggingFace documented example ([narrative](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/using-diffusers/create_a_server) and [code](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/server/server.py)), and provides a peek behind the curtain of inference server deployments without exploring too much of the complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** FastAPI and server development is not within the scope of this class, and serves as a simplified example for those interested. Feel free to run the service as-is and assume the API will roughly work and operate reliably enough to fulfill the exercises, but we do not recommend using this solution for production. If you are interested in productionalizing an image generation server, consider using:\n",
    "- [Stable Diffusion NIM offerings](https://build.nvidia.com/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl) for self-hosted options.\n",
    "- [Automatic1111-style](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Stable-Diffusion-WebUI-TensorRT/tree/main) and [ComfyUI-style](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI_TensorRT) Stable-Diffusion WebUIs for streamlined accelerated deployments. \n",
    "- Hosted APIs like those offered by OpenAI and StabilityAI for non-self-hosted options.\n",
    "- Inference server projects like [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for inspirations on productionalized deployments. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Note The Following Features:**\n",
    "- **This is sufficient for a background server that mimics OpenAI's Dalle API for a single-user use-case.**\n",
    "- It roughly follows OpenAI's Dalle API with minimal functionality of generating a novel image.\n",
    "- Once the server is running, other services can call it via a port interface without having to reload or re-construct the resource allocated in the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Note The Following Critical Limitations:**\n",
    "- **It is explicitly not threadsafe!** This is outlined in the documentation narrative, and is important for multi-user use-cases. This server is only sufficient for a single user with relatively little allowed concurrency. \n",
    "- **There is no meaningful model discovery endpoint,** and it is generally non-trivial for an external user to understand how to use this server without digging into the code. This is omitted for brevity, since you have full access to the code.\n",
    "- **The server saves the file directly to a temporary file on the host system.** This is simplified for convenience, and is sufficient for meaningful interactions in a local deployment context.\n",
    "    - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images) would save such an image to a temporary publicly-accessible address. The caller can download the image and operate on it as usual.\n",
    "    - [NVIDIA NIM microservices](https://docs.api.nvidia.com/nim/reference/stabilityai-stable-diffusion-xl-infer), and thereby `build.nvidia.com`, returns a buffer in its response which can be decoded and interpretted as an image by the caller."

    "## **Part 2:** Getting Pre-Made Standardized Servers Using vLLM\n",
    "\n",
    "For a higher layer of abstraction, many people like to use inference services like [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) to help deploy scalable and standardized LLM APIs. This framework automatically integrated with the Transformers model repository to download model weights and deserialize from config to pipeline. At the same time, it also offers abstractions for memory management, multi-user deployment, and API standards to wrap a resilient server around the loaded model resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using vLLM, we will deploy two small models that can run from within this notebook on our A100 resource:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. A small vision language model ([SmolVLM-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct))**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model, developed by HuggingFace TB Research Team for small language model use-cases, uses the multimodal fusion principles from Notebook 5 to perform joint reasoning with images and text. At the same time, it adopts the standard OpenAI-style API to largely interoperate with the likes of [**OpenAI's GPT-4o**](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), [**NVIDIA's NVLM**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402), and the open-sourced [**Llama 3.2 (2024)**](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To deploy an inference server, the following command will work in our environment:\n",

    "vllm serve HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct\n",

    "--max-num-seqs 16\n",
    "--port 9002\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. A small language model with (minimum-viable) tooling support ([Llama-3.2-3B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct))**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model, developed by the META AI research team, offers a small language model that has been trained, to some extend, to abide by function calling to some extend. Of note, this model is not usually recommended for function-calling out-of-the-box without some much-needed fine-tuning, but it can be used sufficiently for our simpler use-cases. \n",

    "- **Port (9001 / 9002):** Defines the specific network port on which the model’s server listens. This lets other processes communicate with our server and send requests to it.\n",
    "- **Max Model Length (8192):** Sets the upper limit for the number of input tokens the model can process in a single operation, affecting the model's ability to handle longer sequences.\n",
    "    - Impacts resource allocation (since KV cache space needs to be allocated), increases maximum per-call inference time/resource use, and opens up opportunies for derailment. \n",
    "- **GPU Memory Utilization (0.4 / 0.5):** Dictates the percentage of the total available GPU memory that each model instance can use, ensuring that some GPU resources are left over for other processes.\n",
    "    - You may notice that our diffusion model server does not have such a configuration... because this a VLLM-specific parameter which is tightly paired with its engine wrapper. Implementing this for diffusion would need to be done manually.\n",
    "    - You may also note that 0.4 + 0.5 + diffusion resources (.17 usually) > 1. This tends to be ok in our specific context because the models require excess memory during construction. An actual productionalized solution should enforce stronger bounds if resilience is required.\n",
    "- **Max Number of Sequences (16):** Controls how many sequences the model can process simultaneously, optimizing both computational efficiency and response time during parallel requests.\n",
    "- **Enforce Eager:** Forces the model to execute operations immediately and in a sequential order, which simplifies debugging and execution traceability.\n",
    "- **Chat Template:** Implements a Jinja template for standardizing API responses, facilitating consistent and predictable interactions with the model.\n",
    "    - In reality, all LLMs that offer a a chat completions API have this format, which helps to convert an intuitive \"message\" format to \"LLM input\" format. It's important here because the version that is passed in [implemented here and advertised to work well for Llama 3.2](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/examples/tool_chat_template_llama3.2_json.jinja), defines several non-default edge cases that enable things like function calling. \n",
