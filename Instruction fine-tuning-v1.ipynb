In this lab, let's use the [BLEU score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU), a metric originally intended to check the quality of translations made by translation models. You can calculate the BLEU scores for individual generated segments by comparing them with a set of expected outputs and average the scores for the individual segments.
